                        <h3>Controls blood sugar levels</h3>
    
                        <p>
                            
                            The first option is to grow the plant from seed! First, buy great quality seeds from any nearby nursery, then take a seed starting mix that is full of natural fertilizers, sow the seed in the soil, place the small pot in bright sunlight and mist the plant on a regular basis. You will notice that the seed will sprout in 10 to 15 days, do not lose hope. Once the seed is sprouted enough, you can transfer the plant into a big pot as per your liking.


If getting seeds is not an option for you or you already have a plant at your home, simply cut off 6 to 7 inches long stem from the plant. Before cutting, make sure that the stem is full of leaf nodes and make a clean 45-degree cut. Plant the stem in soil full of fertilizers in a pot, keep the pot in a place where there's plenty of indirect yet bright sunlight, and water the plant daily. Once you notice that leaves are sprouting from the plant, wait for almost ten days and slowly get it out in the bright sunlight.
                        </p>




                        <h3>Taking Care of Giloy</h3>
    
                        <p>
                            
                            Water: Check the top of the soil, and if it feels dry, then water the plant deeply. Wait for the soil to dry out completely before watering again, and do not overwater the plant.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sunlight: The plant needs bright sunlight for around 5 to 7 hours per day. However, initially, it's better to keep it out of harsh direct sunlight.
                            
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Soil: The plant flourishes in well-drained soil with a ph level of 5.5 to 7. You can go for a normal potting mix, or you can make your own soil by adding four parts of normal garden soil, one part of manure and one part of river sand.
                            
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Climate: As giloy plant is native to India itself, it flourishes perfectly in dry and hot climates that have moderate rainfall. Hence, you do not have to worry about creating an ideal climate for the plant.
                            
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            
                            Finally… Giloy is an excellent plant that serves as a great medicinal help in times of need. Therefore, making a little effort for this green fellow would be a great investment, happy gardening!
